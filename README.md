Kuro Kosmico | Systems & Game Feel Consulting
Kuro Kosmico is a specialized consultancy focused on the mechanical heart of video games. I bridge the gap between complex narrative systems—such as those found in Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere—and intuitive, satisfying gameplay.

🎯 The Mission
To ensure that a game's "feel" matches its lore. I specialize in translating intricate magic systems (Allomancy, Feruchemy) and deep narrative rules into functional Blueprints and Mechanical Bibles for development teams.

🛠 Services
Gameplay Engineering: Prototyping physics-based movement and complex input mapping.
Systems Architecture: Designing the UX/UI logic for resource-heavy mechanics (e.g., Feruchemical storage).
Game Feel Consultation: "White-box" testing to eliminate mechanical friction and refine controller responsiveness.
External QA & Technical Reporting: Professional bug tracking with a focus on systemic consistency.

🚀 Technical Expertise
Engine: 4+ years of experience in Unity.
Specialization: Systems design, minimalist UI, and physics-driven character controllers.
Methodology: Independent prototyping that requires no NDA to begin and ensures total IP protection for the client.

📬 Contact
If you are a developer looking for a "fresh set of eyes" on your mechanics, or a rights-holder looking to protect your IP's gameplay identity, let's talk.
